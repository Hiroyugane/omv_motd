## About this fork

This fork will become a customized and more structurized approach to the original motd(-python)-script by fedya, which got forked.
Once it will be an actual (beta)-release, anyone should be able to use it on debian-based systems and it should be possible to write own extensions or modules for the data *you* want to see
